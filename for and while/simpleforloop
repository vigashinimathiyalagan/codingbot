######## Problem 1 ###############
#write multiplication table like this
# 1 * 1 = 1
# 1 * 2 = 2
#etc. Get the number as input
multiplicationNumber = int(input("Enter the number for multiplication: "))
noOfEntries = int(input("How many rows do you want to print: "))

for i in range(1, noOfEntries + 1):
    print(i, "*", multiplicationNumber, "=", i * multiplicationNumber)
output:
Enter the number for multiplication: 5
How many rows do you want to print: 10
1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50


######## Problem 2 ###############
#Write a program that prints out the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
#example 1,2,3,5,8 , next number is the sum of previous two numbers.

# Get the limit from the user
limit = int(input("Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence: "))

def fibonacci_sequence(limit):
    sequence = [1, 1]  # Initialize the sequence with the first two numbers
    while sequence[-1] <= limit:
        next_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
        if next_number <= limit:
            sequence.append(next_number)
        else:
            break
    return sequence

# Generate and print the Fibonacci sequence
fib_sequence = fibonacci_sequence(limit)
print("Fibonacci sequence up to", limit, ":")
print(fib_sequence)


output:
Enter the limit for the Fibonacci sequence: 7
Fibonacci sequence up to 7 :
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
